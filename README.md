# Project Description

Today the "customer journey" for a pregnant woman to find a suitable hospital, to register at said hospital and to finally give birth, comprises a lot of pains (i.e. how to find the best fitting hospital, the registration, ...). In order to make this journey more enjoyable and easier, this project aims to assist pregnant woman in this process by optimizing and digitalizing it.

The objective is to make it as enjoyable and easy as possible for pregnant women. The main points will be explained below.

## Chatbot to find a suitable hospital

A chatbot will assist the pregnant women in finding a hospital which suits their wishes (like the way of giving birth, location, ratings, etc.) and to register at said hospital. All this happens through a conversation with the chatbot in which the wishes are analysed and suggestions presented. Once the hospital is found, the woman can immediately register for a first meeting through the chatbot. The meeting will then be confirmed by e-mail or SMS. 24 hours before the meeting, the woman receives a reminder and will have to confirm that she will attend the meeting. During the meeting the chatbot will again be used to register important information about the patient and the pregnancy. 

## Facial recognition to identify the patient

Once the birth is imminent, instead of calling the hospital to inform them, the pregnant woman can just go to the hospital. At the entrance the facial recognition system will recognize her. With this, the staff gets alarmed, the woman picked up and the room prepared. All of this happening without having to register at the reception or filling out any administrative sheets.
